      For most intents and purposes, we do not create or manage user accounts.
      The user's browser stores state locally via LocalStorage. Users may
      upload attachments, which are stored in S3 with a random identifier;
      only the user's browser knows how to connect a specific user with their
      data. Users submit a single bundle of comments, which triggers the
      LocalStorage to be cleared.

      Aside from public-facing access, there is a HTTP BASIC AUTH-protected
      data-writing interface. Combined, the username and password are 32
      randomly generated hex characters. For more details, see

    narrative: >
      Users are only permitted access to their own data. While the user is
      adding comments, data is stored in their local browser alone. Uploaded
      files and generated pdfs are accessible via S3 URLs with appropriate
      signatures (with a timeout of one hour) -- for more information, see
      http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html
      . Aside from S3, once data is submitted, it is not retrievable.
