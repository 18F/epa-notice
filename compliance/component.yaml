    narrative: >
      Within our application (see cloud.gov for lower-level controls), user
      accounts are not created or managed. The user's browser stores state
      locally via LocalStorage. Users may upload attachments, which are stored
      in S3 with a random identifier; only the user's browser knows how to
      connect a specific user with their data. Users submit a single bundle of
      comments, which triggers the LocalStorage to be cleared.

    control_key: AC-3   # Access Enforcement
    narrative: >
      At the application level (see cloud.gov for lower-level controls),
      access restrictions are largely enforced by HTTP BASIC AUTH credentials.
      These are necessary to write regulatory data to the system or to access
      any pages when in a staging environment. Combined, the user name and
      password are 32 randomly generated hexadecimal characters. For more
      details, see https://github.com/eregs/notice-and-comment#updating-data.
      The ability to write (and submit) comments is further restricted by a
      date check (commenting is only available within a specific time frame),
      though there is little harm in accepting comments outside of this
      window.

    control_key: AC-6   # Least Privilege
    narrative: >
      At the application level (see cloud.gov for lower-level controls), users
      are only permitted access to their own data. While the user is adding
      comments, data is stored in their local browser. Uploaded files and
      generated pdfs *are* accessible via S3 URLs, but require correct
      signatures and must be used within an hour of issuance. For more
      information, see
      http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html.
      Aside from S3, once data is submitted, it is not retrievable.
