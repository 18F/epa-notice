    narrative: >
      For most intents and purposes, we do not create or manage user accounts.
      The user's browser stores state locally via LocalStorage. Users may
      upload attachments, which are stored in S3 with a random identifier;
      only the user's browser knows how to connect a specific user with their
      data. Users submit a single bundle of comments, which triggers the
      LocalStorage to be cleared.
