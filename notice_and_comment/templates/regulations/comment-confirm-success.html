  <h4>What will happen to your comment</h4>
  <h5>EPA will process it and in most cases will post it publicly</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      EPA will process your comment, which may take a few days or weeks depending
      on the number of comments received. In a few cases EPA may decline to evaluate
      or post your comment, as listed in
      <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets#rules" target="_blank">
        its rules and restrictions for comments <span class="cf-icon cf-icon-external-link"></span>
      </a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      In most cases, EPA will post your comment to
      {% comment %}TODO: Replace static text with this link
      <a href="#" target="_blank">the docket folder for this proposed rule <span class="cf-icon cf-icon-external-link"></span></a>.
      {% endcomment %}
      the docket folder for this proposed rule.
      Then you will be able to find your comment there or by searching
      <a href="https://www.regulations.gov" target="_blank">Regulations.gov <span class="cf-icon cf-icon-external-link"></span></a>
      for your comment tracking number or keywords from your comment.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5>EPA will review eligible comments and will usually publish a final rule</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      After this comment period ends, EPA will review the comments, and usually
      EPAâ€™s next step is to prepare a final rule that includes responses to major
      comments. EPA may decide to not go through with preparing a final rule,
      although this is unusual.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you'd like to hear about the potential final rule, you can
      <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/environmental-protection-agency" target="_blank">
