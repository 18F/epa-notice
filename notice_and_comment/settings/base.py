                 proposing to add a subsurface intrusion (SsI) component to
                 the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) which is the principal
                 mechanism that EPA uses to evaluate sites for placement on
                 the National Priorities List (NPL). The subsurface intrusion
                 component (this addition) would expand the number of
                 available options for EPA and state and tribal organizations
                 performing work on behalf of EPA to evaluate potential
                 threats to public health from releases of hazardous
                 substances, pollutants, or contaminants. This addition will
                 allow an HRS evaluation to directly consider human exposure
                 to hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants that
                 enter regularly occupied structures through subsurface
                 intrusion in assessing a site's relative risk, and thus,
                 enable subsurface intrusion contamination to be evaluated for
                 placement of sites on the NPL. The agency is not considering
                 changes to the remainder of the HRS except for minor updates
                 reflecting changes in terminology.""",
